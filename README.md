# Cannon-s-algorithm-project
Project of parallel computation of Matrix multiplication. This was part of the course Parallel Computations for Large-Scale Problems at KTH.

## Planning

27/3: Discussed practicalities + DLs + strategies to deal with non square matrices and non square processor grids.
3/4: Further and final discussions on non square cases.
12/4: Itermediate meeting. The implementation of the parallel algorithm should be done
